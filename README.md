This is a genetic cellular automaton created by Reese Johnston and
minorly modified by Nathan Weizenbaum. The survival of each cell is
determined by playing the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Each cell has
its own strategy, which is passed on to other cells (with a chance of
mutation) if it wins the prisoner's dilemma.

The code depends on DrawingPanel by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp,
